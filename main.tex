\title{Millikelvin-precision temperature sensing for advanced cryogenic detectors}

\input{authorlist.tex}
\date{\today}

\begin{abstract}
Precise temperature monitoring  ---to the level of a few milli-Kelvin--- is essential for the operation of large-scale cryostats requiring a recirculation system. In particular, the performance of Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers ---such as those planned for the DUNE experiment--- strongly relies on proper argon purification and mixing, which can be characterized by a sufficiently dense grid of high-precision temperature probes. In this article, we present a novel technique for the cross-calibration of Resistance Temperature Detectors in cryogenic liquids, developed as part of the temperature monitoring system for a DUNE prototype. This calibration has enabled the validation and optimization of the systemâ€™s components, achieving an unprecedented precision of 2.5 mK.

%Precise monitoring of temperatures to the level of a few millikelvin has been identified as crucial for understanding the properties and behaviour of cryogenic liquids in large cryostats. In particular, the performance of Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers, as the ones of the DUNE experiment, heavily relies on proper argon purification and mixing, which can be characterized using a sufficiently dense grid of high-precision temperature probes. In this article, a novel technique for the cross-calibration of Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs) in cryogenic liquids (argon and nitrogen) is presented, obtaining an unprecedented precision of 2.5 mK.
